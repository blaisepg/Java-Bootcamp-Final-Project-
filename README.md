# Java Bootcamp Final Project
Java Bootcamp 2018 Final Project from Grand Circus Detroit

For our Grand Circus final project I and my team designed and developed from the scrarch a fashion cast web application called "Weather Or Not", 
which tells you what to wear based on the weather of where you are in US. To use this web application you need to create an account in order to open your own closet by uploading the pictures of all your clothes. To build this web application we utilized these technologies:

   1. Spring MVC framework.
   2. Wunderground weather API to get the weather information needed for this web application in JSON format.
   3. Cloudinary API to manage and load the pictures by storing the URL for the specified item image in the database built in MySQL.
   4. Design patterns: Singleton ( to manage the session factory), MVC, DAO for each of the POJO to access the data.
   5. Hibernate to interact with the database built in MySQL.
   6. Git/Github to collaborate on the project by keeping track of all changes.
   7. Debug the code by testing frequently as we added more code and refactoring as needed.
   8. On the front-end side we used HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and JSPs.
