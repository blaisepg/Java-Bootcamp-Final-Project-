# Java-Bootcamp-Final-Project-
Java Bootcamp 2018 Final Project from Grand Circus Detroit

For Grand Circus final project I and my team designed and developed from the scrarch a fashion cast web application called "Weather Or Not", 
which tells you what to wear based on the weather of whre you are in US. To use this web application you need to create an account in order
to open your own closet by uploading the pictures of all your clothes.
